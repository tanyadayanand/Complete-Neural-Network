# Complete-Neural-Network
Building a complete neural network using Numpy. I will implement all the steps required to build a network - feedforward, loss computation, backpropagation, weight updates etc. I will using the MNIST dataset to train the model to classify handwritten digits between 0-9.
It is divided into the following sections:

Data preparation
Feedforward
Loss computation
Backpropagation
Parameter updates
Model training and predictions
